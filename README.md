# Etch-a-sketch

In this project I am making an etch-a-sketch. 

1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of divs. Use Javascript. 

2. Create a hover effect that makes the divs change color when the mouse passes over them.

3. Add a button that clears the current grid and asks the user for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
The new grid should be the same total number of pixels as the old grid, even if the number of squares is different.

4. Add an effect that makes each pass of the mouse turn a square a random RGB color, and make it get 10% darker with each pass.
